        <p>
          Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, popularly known as Mahatma Gandhi, was a
          prominent leader in the Indian independence movement against British
          colonial rule. He advocated for nonviolent civil disobedience and played
          a key role in India's struggle for freedom.
        </p>
        <h3>Early Life and Education</h3>
        <p>
          Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India. He studied law
          in London and eventually became a lawyer in South Africa. It was during
          his time in South Africa that he developed his philosophy of nonviolent
          resistance, which he called Satyagraha.
        </p>
        <h3>Salt March and Civil Disobedience</h3>
        <p>
          One of Gandhi's most significant acts of civil disobedience was the Salt
          March in 1930, where he and his followers walked to the Arabian Sea to
          make their own salt in protest of British salt taxes. This act of
          defiance gained international attention and became a symbol of India's
          fight for independence.
        </p>
        <h3>Legacy and Impact</h3>
        <p>
          Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy of nonviolence and civil disobedience
          inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. He
          worked tirelessly to unite different religious and ethnic communities in
          India. His efforts culminated in India gaining independence from British
          rule on August 15, 1947.
        </p>
        <h3>Assassination and Rememberance</h3>
        <p>
          Tragically, Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated on January 30, 1948, by a
          Hindu nationalist who opposed his views. However, his legacy lives on as
          an icon of peace, justice, and human rights.
